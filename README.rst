Collect 433Mhz weather sensor data and publish to mqtt.

This software is designed to use an rtl 433 compatible receiver, and relay the
data found on it over an mqtt bus so that it can be consumed by other software,
such as Home Assistant.

=========================

You will need a Linux system (raspberry pi is sufficient) and a 433 MHz
receiver. This supports rtl-sdr dongles.

- Install hardware + support code

- you must also install the rtl433 project from source.

=============

Copy the config.yml.sample file and modify it accordingly.
